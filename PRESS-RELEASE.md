# Poliviz #

## For voters looking for insights on politicians. ##

## Summary ##
  PoliViz is a political data visualization app focusing on campaign contribution/finance information. 

## Problem ##
  Data is dispersed, boring, and tedious. Many users find it difficult to sift through data, but it's important that political data gets to voters so they can make informed decisions. 

  PoliViz 1.0 was a great success, but we would like to find out more information about campaign contributions. In particular, it would be great to see the relationships between contributors and candidates.

## Solution ##
  PoliViz 2.0 focuses on campaign finances and expands the campaign contribution visualization from its predecessor. We are adding new data and providing users with an interesting way of exploring candidate and contributor information.
